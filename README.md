# Search Ranking Index

This is an implementation for an interview assignment provided by [Sellics SaaS products](https://sellics.com/)

## Description:
- The application loads the csv file on startup and stores it in a static variable. This can be replaced by an inmemory db or any other db in future
- To add different csv file, use the api's '/ingest-data/ingest-from-file' or '/ingest-from-s3'. New csv file will override the existing csv data 
- Use '/smart-index/ind-ranks/{asin}/{keyword}' api to get time series containing the individual ranks for an ASIN, for a certain keyword
- Use '/smart-index/agg-ranks?keyword={keyword}' api to get time series containing the aggregated ranks for all ASINs for a certain keyword
- Use '/smart-index/agg-ranks?asin={asin}' api to get time series containing the aggregated ranks of all keywords for a certain ASIN

### ðŸ”¨ Main technologies used

- [Java 11](https://developer.oracle.com/java11/), the worldâ€™s most popular development platform
- [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot), an open source Java-based framework
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/what-is-maven.html), a software project management and comprehension tool

### Prerequisites

You will need to have Java 11 installed. Refer [here](https://developer.oracle.com/java11/) for installation instructions

### Build and Run

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

1. Clone the code from git, go to the project folder and install dependencies:

```sh
mvn clean install
```

2. Start the application

```sh
mvn spring-boot:run
```

3. To access the application [http://localhost:8080/api/v1/swagger-ui/index.html](http://localhost:8080/api/v1/swagger-ui/index.html) in your browser
